# 🚖 Uber Rides Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the **number of Uber rides (Run)** in a given region using machine learning models.  
The prediction is based on socio-economic and service-related features such as population, income, pricing, and parking availability.  
The model can help ride-hailing companies like Uber optimize **resource allocation, pricing strategies, and service planning**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following key features:

- **Price per week** → Average weekly fare/pricing.
- **Population** → Population of the region.
- **Monthly income** → Average monthly income of people in that region.
- **Average parking per month** → Availability of parking spaces per month.
- **Run** → Target variable, representing the number of Uber rides (demand).

## 📈 Results

The model predicts the demand for Uber rides based on economic and regional factors.

Key insights:

Higher population → higher demand.

Higher parking availability → demand decreases.

Price sensitivity: demand changes depending on fare levels.

Monthly income positively affects ride usage.
